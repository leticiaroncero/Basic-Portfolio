# Basic-Portfolio

[Link to deployed site.](https://leticiaroncero.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a professional portfolio site using HTML and CSS, while following some basic design specs, and applying properties like floats, display, overflow, etc. to build the layout. The site has three pages: a 'Bio' with information about us, a 'Portfolio' with thumbnails/images that link to projects we've completed in the past, and a 'Contact' page with a form for potential visitors to message us.  

## Technologies used

- HTML5

## Essential Code

CSS to position and format the header and navigation menu. It also handles the separator between each menu element:

CSS to style the H tags. I used an H1 for the main title, H2 for the section titles, and H3 for the image titles:

Styling the containers for the Portfolio page. Each box contains an image,a title, and a link. The link is positioned to cover the entire box, making each thumbnail clickable. Images are resized to fit its container with proper aspect ratio.
